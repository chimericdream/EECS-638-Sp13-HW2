# EECS 638 - Homework 2
## Spring 2013

This is the repository for Bill Parrott's submission for the [Introduction to Expert Systems](http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~jerzy/eecs638.html) class at the [University of Kansas](http://www.ku.edu/).

### Compiling the program
There is a makefile included with this submission that copies the necessary OPS/R2 files and compiles both parts of the assignment.

To compile the program, simply run `make`.

### Running the program
To run part 1 of the assignment, run `./part1` after compiling. The output for part 1 is stored in the files `EVEN.NUMBERS` and `ODD.NUMBERS`.

To run part 2 of the assignment, run `./part2` after compiling. The output for part 2 is stored in the files `EVEN2.NUMBERS` and `ODD2.NUMBERS`.
